## What tasks has each group member been assigned to for Milestone2.

### Tasks:
1. Test suite (4)
2. Driver/API script (7)
3. Documentation (3)
4. Administrative files  (3)
5. Root finding algorithm (4)
6. Function library (3)
7. Docstrings for functions (7)
8. Proposal for advanced features (e.g., backward mode, applications, nondifferentiable functions?) (3) 
What kinds of things do you want to implement next? How will your software change? What will be the primary challenges to implementing these new features?

* Matt: Function library, test suite (½), doc strings (⅓)
* Zeyuan: Driver (½), Root finding algorithm
* Lily: Test suite (½),  admin files
* Jim: Driver and doc strings (⅔)

All work on documentation and proposal for advanced features.



## What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone1.

* Matt: Wrote Dual.py module and part of admath.py module; set up Sphinx
* Zeyuan: contributed to updating the milestone 2a document; wrote a root-finding demo using our autograd package.
